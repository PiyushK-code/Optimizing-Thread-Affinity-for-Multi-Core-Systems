# Optimizing-Thread-Affinity-for-Multi-Core-Systems

Addressed a threading optimization challenge by efficiently mapping three threads to two physical cores, each supporting 2-way Simultaneous Multithreading. 

Designed a Python script to analyze performance data from profiling logs and implemented an automated thread affinity solution in C++ to dynamically assign threads to logical cores, improving execution efficiency by balancing resource sharing.
